# Your First Blog Post

Welcome to your new blog! This is a sample post to show you how the MDX format works.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to write JSX in your Markdown content. You can include:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- `Code snippets`
- Links to [external sites](https://example.com)
- Lists and other Markdown features

## Code Blocks

You can include syntax-highlighted code blocks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))
```

## Images

You can include images by placing them in the `/public` folder:

![Alt text](/your-image.jpg)

## Interactive Elements

Since this is MDX, you can even include React components if you create them!

## Conclusion

Replace this content with your own thoughts, experiences, and insights. The blog system will automatically:

- Generate a table of contents
- Add syntax highlighting to code blocks
- Create social media previews
- Include your posts in the knowledge graph visualization

Happy writing!
