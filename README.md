# Personal Portfolio & Digital Garden

Interactive portfolio built with Next.js 14, featuring knowledge graphs, 3D visualizations, and geospatial maps. Live at [heilcheng.github.io](https://heilcheng.github.io).

## Key Features

### Knowledge Graph Architecture
D3.js-powered force-directed graphs that visualize semantic relationships:
- Portfolio sections graph with content-based linking
- Blog posts graph with automatic connection generation
- Interactive navigation with drag, zoom, and smooth scrolling
- Collision detection and optimized force simulation parameters

### Geospatial Visualizations
- World map with visited countries using react-simple-maps and TopoJSON
- Interactive Hong Kong spots map built with React Leaflet

### Dynamic Content System
- MDX blog with syntax highlighting
- GitHub contributions visualization
- Real-time data fetching with Next.js App Router

## Tech Stack

**Core**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, React 18

**Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, Magic UI

**Visualization**: D3.js, React Leaflet, react-simple-maps

**3D**: Three.js, React Three Fiber, @react-three/drei

**Content**: MDX, gray-matter, next-mdx-remote

**Tools**: pnpm, ESLint, PostCSS

## Implementation Highlights

**Force Simulation**: Custom D3 parameters with variable link distances, collision detection, and alpha decay tuning

**Static Export**: Next.js configuration for GitHub Pages with image optimization and asset management

**Type Safety**: Strongly-typed data layer with const assertions and discriminated unions

**Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, intersection observers, memoized calculations

## Development

```bash
pnpm install       # Install dependencies
pnpm dev           # Start dev server
pnpm build         # Build for production
pnpm lint          # Run linter
```

## Deployment

Automated via GitHub Actions: push to `main` triggers build and deployment to GitHub Pages.
